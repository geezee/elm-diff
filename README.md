# elm-diff

This is a library to generate diffs. It is not actively developed and is very
slow. The generated Elm code is not optimal and renders the whole project pointless.

Nonetheless the code will still be here in the hopes that it will be useful for
someone. In the case the elm compiler improves I can always get back to this
code and finish it.

Meanwhile, make sure to check the alternative native javascript (ES6) library:
[elmo-diff](../../../elmo-diff)
